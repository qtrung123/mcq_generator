- Base each question on factual information verifiable from textbooks, academic papers, or reliable websites
- Use clear language with no room for misinterpretation
- Ensure no cultural, racial, or gender bias; appropriate for diverse audiences
- Each question must be unique (no duplicates)

COMPETITIVE EXAM STANDARDS:
- Match the difficulty level: Easy (recall/simple application), Medium (analysis/application), Hard (critical thinking/synthesis)

FORMAT:
Each question MUST have exactly {num_options} options ({", ".join(option_letters)}), {correct_answer_instruction}.

Question: [Question text]
{option_format}
{answer_format}

Each question should be solvable independently and represent diverse aspects of {field}.

IMPORTANT:
Return ONLY plain text.
Do NOT use markdown.
Do NOT use bullet points.
Do NOT add explanations.
